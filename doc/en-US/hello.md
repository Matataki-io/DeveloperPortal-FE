# Matataki Developer's Manual
**Welcome to the site, developers!**

The Matataki Developer Center is nearing the end of development, but the documentation is not yet complete, most of the features are fully functional, so please feel free to use all the resources here.

The purpose of the Matataki Developer Center is to provide a port for third-party developers to access and manage their own apps to connect to Matataki and its related resources, and accordingly, to build interesting and fun Dapps that can increase the overall activity of the community, or even develop other user-side apps for Matataki. The above mentioned implementation is not a problem, the Matataki API SDK is still in the planning stage, but most of the content is ready to be used.

For the time being, our development steps and development path will be fully disclosed on GitHub for you to browse and read.
The address is: [DeveloperPortal-FE Project Information Edition](https://github.com/Matataki-io/DeveloperPortal-FE/projects) (current version: version 0.1.0)
This is a project that will evolve and change a lot, and there may be many disruptive updates in the future. In this range, we recommend that you simply try to work with the API provided by the Matataki Developer Center to complete your prototype.
Maybe in the near future we can create a more complete blockchain community together, or we can create a clearinghouse with our leadership. The Developer Center wants to grow and build this area of freedom and creativity with all developers, and like Matataki itself, store your inspiration in your app!

Using the Matataki Developer Center does not require you to know the documentation and code structure of [DeveloperPortal-FE](https://github.com/Matataki-io/DeveloperPortal-FE) itself, nor does it require you to know front-end technologies like Vue.js You only need to understand the use of the RESTful API and the basics of Oauth2 to be able to use it well.

Also, you must be a user of [Matataki.io](https://matataki.io) to become a developer, so if you don't have an account now, go sign up and become one of us!

Throughout the documentation, we recommend using as simple and dynamic a language as possible when building project prototypes, so most of the time we need to involve prototypes and program architecture, we'll use Node.js or Python to do it. If you need help understanding Node.js and Python, you can use [Ten Minute Quickstart to Python - Nuggets](https://juejin.im/post/6844903765410070535) and our three recommended Node.js-related articles: [Node. js Tutorials - Rookie Tutorials](https://www.runoob.com/nodejs/nodejs-tutorial.html), [Javascript Basics and Documentation - MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/zh-CN/ docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/JavaScript_basics), and [node.js Quick Start by angelwgh - Jane's Book](https://www.jianshu.com/p/a955da3703a9 ).

Next, go to [Getting Started](/doc/getstarted) to get started.
